# This app is in a early state, so these are the things to watch out for:
  - During calls you cannot change your volume level
  - Touch and hold to pop out the circle
  - Setting up interface for multi stream control

### Satisfying haptic feedback and animations are coming, and also a one-handed mode, which are unique features, so stay tuned!
