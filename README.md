# This app is in a early state, so these are the things to watch out for:
  - During calls you cannot change your volume level
  - Touch and hold to pop out the circle
  -  Slide right for quick action buttons
  - Multi stream volume control implemented
### Haptic feedback implemented with smooth animations, other features coming, maybe!! so stay tuned!
